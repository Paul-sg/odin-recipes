    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There’s just something about hot, salty fries that we love!</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>large russet potatoes (about 3 pounds), scrubbed and cut into ⅓-inch-thick sticks</li>
        <li>Refined peanut oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Sea salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Add the potatoes to the bowl and soak for 15 minutes. Drain and pat completely dry.</li>
        <li>Attach a deep-fry thermometer to the side of a large, heavy pot. Add the peanut oil to the pot over medium high heat. Once the oil reaches 300°F, working in batches, carefully add the potatoes to the hot oil, and cook until beginning to soften, 3-4 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to a paper-towel-lined sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Increase the oil temperature to 350°F. Working in batches, return the potatoes to the hot oil and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer the fries to the paper-towel-lined sheet pan. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            Note: Instead of cutting into sticks, you can use a mandolin slicer that has a ⅜ -inch setting.</li>
        </ol>

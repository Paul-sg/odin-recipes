     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Mary Berry's gorgeous chocolate roulade is made without flour so it's light as a feather.</p>
     <h3>Ingridients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>175g/6oz good-quality dark chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li>6 free-range eggs, yolk and white separated</li>
        <li>175g/6oz caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
        <li>300ml/10fl oz double cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <Ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160 Fan/Gas 4. Lightly grease a 33cm x 23cm/13in x 9in Swiss roll tin then line the base and sides of the tin with a large sheet of greaseproof paper, pushing it into the corners.</li>
        <li>Melt the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. (Do not let the base of the bowl touch the water.) Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Place the egg whites in a large bowl and whisk until stiff but not dry. If you turn the bowl upside down, the whites should be stiff enough not to fall out.</li>
        <li>Place the egg yolks in a separate bowl with the sugar and whisk on high speed for 2-3 minutes or until thick and creamy and the mixture leaves a thick ribbon-like trail when the beaters are lifted. Pour in the cooled chocolate and gently fold together until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gently stir two large spoonfuls of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to loosen the mix, then fold in the remaining egg whites using a large metal spoon (you don’t want to squash out the air you have just beaten in). Sift in the cocoa and lightly fold it in. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and gently move the tin around until the mixture is level.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until risen and the top feels firm and slightly crisp. Remove from the oven, leave in the tin (expect the roulade to fall and crack a little) and set aside until cold.</li>
        <li>Whip the cream until it forms soft peaks when the whisk is removed.</li>
        <li>Lay a large piece of greaseproof paper on the work surface and dust it lightly with icing sugar. Turn the roulade out on to the paper so its lining paper is on top, then carefully peel off the paper. Spread the roulade with the whipped cream, leaving a border of about 2cm/¾in all the way around the edges</li>
        <li>With one of the shortest edges facing you, make a cut along it with a sharp knife, going about half way through the sponge. This will help to make a tight centre of the spiral. Now roll this cut edge over tightly to start with and use the paper to help continue the tight rolling, by pulling it away from you as you roll. Don’t worry if the roulade cracks - that is quite normal and all part of its charm.</li>
        <li>Finish with the join underneath then lift the roulade onto a serving plate or board using a large wide spatula or two fish slices. Dust with icing sugar.</li>

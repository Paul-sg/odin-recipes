    <h1>Greek Salad </h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>   
    <p>Also known as horiatiki, this traditional Greek recipe is made with cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, Kalamata olives, thinly sliced red onion, and feta. That said, this salad is adaptable based on your tastes and what you can find at the store. When tomatoes aren't in season, we prefer grape or cherry varieties because they're usually juicier and less mealy than winter tomatoes on the vine. When shopping, select whatever type of tomatoes looks best to you.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>1 cucumber, thinly sliced into half-moons</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion, thinly sliced</li>

            <li>1/4 c. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        
        </ol>
